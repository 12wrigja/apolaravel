## APO Laravel

This is the source code for [apo.case.edu](http://www.apo.case.edu).

### Contributing

The website is built on the Laravel framework for php. Development is
is done in a vagrant box to maintain sanity accross development platforms.
The box is known as Laravel Homestead. This also has the effect of making the
initial setup a breeze!

After cloning the project and starting a vagrant box,
migrating the database is the last step you need before developing on
apo.case.edu
